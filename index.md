# Gender Classification of Personal Names for Japanese Text

## Introduction

According to the Japan National Census, more than 40% of repondents who give their occupation as designer are women. This has been true since the 1990 census. On the other hand, the share of creators listed on Japanese registered designs who are women is unknown, but is certainly much lower, perhaps 10%. This project aims to quantify this share by developing name-gender data resources for estimating the genders of creators.

Two types of data resources are in development:

1. Individually searched given names selected from persons listed in Japanese registered designs

Registered designs published by the Japan Patent and Trademark Office list persons in three roles: 1) examiners, 2) agents, and 3) creators. One approach to identifying genders of given names is to search for actual persons with those names and record names and either disclosed or perceived binary genders. While this can provide maximal coverage of names listed in registered designs, it is not clear whether or not this data can be subjected to statistical tests and can be applied to other name collections.

2. Collections of given names obtained from internet sources

So far, two kinds of internet sources have been indentified that can be used for statistical estimation of gender based on given names. The first kind is gender-specific Wikipedia categories. The second kind is gender-specific sports rosters, particularly marathon rosters.
