# Gender Classification of Personal Names for Japanese Text

## Introduction

According to the Japan National Census, more than 40% of repondents who give their occupation as designer are women. This has been true since the 1990 census. On the other hand, the share of creators listed on Japanese registered designs who are women is unknown, but is certainly much lower, perhaps 10%. This project aims to quantify this share by developing name-gender data resources for estimating the genders of creators.

Two types of data resources are in development:

1. Individually searched given names selected from persons listed in Japanese registered designs

2. Given name collections obtained from internet sources
