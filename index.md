# Gender Classification of Personal Names for Japanese Text

## Abstract

A database of 3969 unique female and 10680 unique male personal names from Japanese text was created from actual persons searched and identified on the internet, with 24 name-gender pairs taken from O'Neill (1972). Of these, 257 unique personal names are shared by the female and male lists. This repository describes the construction of this database, provides a table of these unique names, and demonstrates estimating genders of personal names using last character estimation.
